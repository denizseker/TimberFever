2.9.0
#### Added
- [Hybrid Shader] Added the "Hybrid Shader 2", which changes the way the shader handles render pipelines internally. This will improve compatibility and maintainability with future URP versions, and allow easier shader variants stripping.
You can also now entirely exclude features you don't use from the shader code, to reduce the total variants count, build filesize and runtime memory usage. Please read the documentation to know more.
*NOTE 1:* Your materials using the old "Hybrid Shader" will need to be updated, a script will propose to do that automatically when you update TCP2, or you can use the menu option in "Tools/Toony Colors Pro/Upgrade materials".
*NOTE 2:* Lightmap support is now disabled by default because it dramatically reduces the number of shader variants; select the shader file and toggle "Lightmap" in the options to enable it back.
- [Hybrid Shader] Added support for URP 12 features: "Decals", "Light Layers", "Light Cookies"
- [Shader Generator 2] (BIRP) (URP) Added options to enable LOD Crossfading for both render pipelines
- [Shader Generator 2] (BIRP) (URP) Added procedural dithering pattern options when using "Dithered Transparency"
#### Modified
- Legacy "Desktop" and "Mobile" shaders have been removed. You can use the menu option "Tools/Toony Colors Pro/Upgrade materials/From Legacy Desktop-Mobile to Hybrid Shader 2" to upgrade your legacy materials to using the "Hybrid Shader 2"
- Removed "TCP2_BuildShaderPreprocessor" script that was used to strip out Hybrid Shader variants ("Hybrid Shader 2" does a better job at stripping out of the box)
- Minimum Unity version for TCP2 is now Unity 2019.4.12
#### Fixed
- [Shader Generator 2] "Other Shader Property" references should now accept the same as the Base property with properties from Material Layers
- [Shader Generator 2] Reloading a template will not clear the Shader Properties settings anymore

- [Shader Generator 2] Vertical Fog: added new options (space, make optional)
#### Modified

- Cat Demo Scene: fixed mesh references in Unity 2019.1+

2.4.1
- As of version 2.4.0, the "Shaders 2.0" folder has been renamed to "Shaders".
  Any shaders and files in "Shaders 2.0" or a sub-folder (e.g. "Variants") has to be moved there for the shaders to compile properly.
- Added HTML formatted changelog
- Fixed packed shaders that were unpacking in the wrong folder, causing an #include error

2.4.0

- Shader Generator: Added "VertExmotion" support (under "Special Effects")
- Shader Generator: Enabled Dithered Shadows when using Alpha Testing with "Dithered Transparency"
- Shader Generator: fixed Outline in Single-Pass Stereo rendering mode (VR)
- Added 26 MatCap textures
- Reorganized the Textures folder
- Renamed the "Shaders 2.0" folder to "Shaders"
- Added namespaces for all TCP2 classes (except material inspectors for compatibility)
- Added .asmdef files for TCP2 scripts (Unity 2019.1+)

2.3.572

2.3.571
- Shader Generator: "Default" template: fixed Specular Mask when using PBR Blinn-Phong or GGX models
- Shader Generator: "PBS" templates: fixed compilation issues on builds when using outlines
- Shader Generator: "Surface PBS" template: fixed Emission feature
- Shader Generator: "Water" template: fixed precision issue causing artifacts on some mobile platforms
- Shader Generator: fixed "Constant Size Outline" option so that it ignores objects' scale
- Shader Generator: UI fixes with inline features

2.3.57
- Shader Generator: upgraded "SRP/Lightweight" template to latest version (4.1.0-preview with Unity 2018.3.0b9)
- Shader Generator: "Default" template: fixed "Pixel MatCap" option when using a normal map with skinned meshes
- Shader Generator: always start with a new shader when opening the tool (don't load the last generated/loaded shader anymore)
- Added example MatCap textures
- Removed 'JMOAssets.dll', became obsolete with the Asset Store update notification system

2.3.56
- Shader Generator: added "Texture Blending" feature for "Surface PBS" template
- Shader Generator: fixed non-repeating tiling for "Texture Blending" in relevant templates
- Shader Generator: fixed masks for "Surface PBS" template (Albedo Color Mask, HSV Mask, Subsurface Scattering Mask)
- Added default non-repeating tiling noise textures

2.3.55
- Shader Generator: added "Silhouette Pass" option: simple solid color silhouette for when objects are behind obstacles

- Shader Generator: added more Tessellation options for "Default" template: Fixed, Distance Based and Edge Length Based
- Shader Generator: added Tessellation support for "Standard PBS" template
- Desktop/Mobile shaders: removed Directional Lightmap support for shaders, so that all variants can compile properly (max number of interpolators was reached for some combination in Unity 2018+)
- Mpbile shaders: disabled view direction calculated in the vertex shader, will be calculated in the fragment instead, so that all variants compile properly (slightly slower but it frees up one interpolator)
- Shader Generator: restored 'VertexLit' fallback for Surface PBS template, so that shadow receiving works by default

2.3.53
- Shader Generator: added "Shadow Color Mode" feature with "Replace Color" option to entirely replace the Albedo with the shadow color
